  * **PDF Generation Library:** Tools like **ReportLab** (Python) or similar for dynamic, server-side PDF creation, ensuring professional quote documents.

### Deployment & Infrastructure (Future Consideration)

* **Cloud Provider:** **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, or **Microsoft Azure** - For scalable, secure, and reliable hosting of the application.
* **Containerization:** **Docker** - To package the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
* **Orchestration:** **Kubernetes** - For automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (for larger-scale, high-availability deployments).

## Installation & Setup (For Developers)

To get a local development environment up and running for the Praximous Solar Panel Calculator, please follow these detailed steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Node.js (LTS version):** Required for frontend development (`npm` or `yarn` is bundled with Node.js).
* **Python 3.9+:** Required for backend development.
* **pip:** Python package installer (comes with Python).
* **PostgreSQL:** Database server instance running locally or accessible.
* **Docker & Docker Compose:** (Highly Recommended) For consistent environment setup and running services in isolation.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone the Praximous Solar Calculator repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praximous/solar-calculator.git
cd solar-calculator
```

### 2\. Backend Setup

Navigate into the `backend` directory and set up the Python environment:

```bash
cd backend
```

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the database and backend running without local installs.

1. **Create `.env` file:** Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory. Populate it with the necessary environment variables.

    ```env
    # Database connection for Docker
    POSTGRES_DB=solar_db
    POSTGRES_USER=solar_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=solar_password

    # Django specific
    SECRET_KEY='your_very_secret_key_here_for_django' # IMPORTANT: Change this for production!
    DEBUG=True # Set to False in production
    ALLOWED_HOSTS='localhost,127.0.0.1' # Add your domain in production

    # API Keys (replace with your actual keys)
    Maps_API_KEY='your_Maps_api_key'
    PVGIS_API_KEY='your_pvgis_api_key' # If PVGIS requires one (often not, but good to plan)
    EMAIL_HOST='smtp.your-email-provider.com'
    EMAIL_PORT=587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
    EMAIL_HOST_USER='your_email_username'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your_email_password'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL='no-reply@praximous.com'
    ```

2. **Build and run services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This will build the Docker images, create the database, run migrations, and start the backend server.
3. **Access Backend:** The backend API should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

#### Manual Backend Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Create a Python virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create `.env` file:** Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory. Populate it with the necessary environment variables, adjusting database connection details for your local PostgreSQL setup.

    ```env
    # Database connection for local PostgreSQL
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://solar_user:solar_password@localhost:5432/solar_db

    # Django specific
    SECRET_KEY='your_very_secret_key_here_for_django' # IMPORTANT: Change this for production!
    DEBUG=True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS='localhost,127.0.0.1'

    # API Keys (replace with your actual keys)
    Maps_API_KEY='your_Maps_api_key'
    PVGIS_API_KEY='your_pvgis_api_key'
    EMAIL_HOST='smtp.your-email-provider.com'
    EMAIL_PORT=587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
    EMAIL_HOST_USER='your_email_username'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your_email_password'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL='no-reply@praximous.com'
    ```

    **Note:** Make sure your `solar_db` database and `solar_user` with `solar_password` exist and have appropriate permissions in your local PostgreSQL instance.
4. **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The backend API will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal window**, navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

1. **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

2. **Create `.env` file:** Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` directory:

    ```env
    # Points to your backend API
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
    ```

3. **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, sales personnel can access the application through their web browser.

1. **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. **Input Customer Details:** Enter the potential customer's name, address, and average electricity consumption.
3. **Define Roof Parameters:** Input detailed roof dimensions, select the roof type, precisely mark any obstructions (chimneys, skylights, etc.), and specify the roof's pitch and orientation (azimuth).
