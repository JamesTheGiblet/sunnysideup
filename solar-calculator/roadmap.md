# SunnySideUp Solar Panel Calculator Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development plan for the Praximous Solar Panel Calculator MVP, incorporating agile principles, modular design, and robust testing at each stage. It clearly marks the point at which the product will be ready for an MVP presentation.

## Core Principles

* **Asynchronous Development:** Teams/developers can work on different components concurrently, minimizing blocking dependencies.
* **Modular & Small Files:** Codebase will be broken down into small, single-responsibility modules/components/functions, promoting reusability, testability, and easier maintenance.
* **Full-Stack Cohesion:** While backend and frontend tasks are separated, consistent communication and API contract definition will ensure seamless integration. For the stack, we'll align with the proposed Python/Django (Backend) and React (Frontend) as it offers similar benefits to MERN for this project's scope (a robust backend and a dynamic frontend).
* **Bio-Driven Design (User-Centric & Intuitive):** Focus on designing user flows that feel natural and intuitive for the sales team. The GUI should mimic real-world interactions where possible, reducing cognitive load and training time.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) mindset:** Prioritize writing tests early in the development cycle.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Calculation Engine (MVP Critical)

**Goal:** Establish the backend infrastructure, define core data models, and build the calculation logic for solar proposals.

### Tasks to Complete (Phase 1)

* **1.1. Project Setup & Version Control**
  * Initialize Git repository (`solar-calculator`).
  * Set up `backend` (Django/Flask) and `frontend` (React) project structures.
  * Configure `.gitignore` files for both.
  * Establish project management board (e.g., Trello, Jira, Asana) for task tracking.
* **1.2. Backend (Data Models & Core Logic)**
  * **1.2.1. Database Design:** Define schemas for:
    * `Products`: Solar panels (wattage, dimensions, cost), Inverters, Mounting Hardware.
    * `Quotes`: Customer info, calculated values, timestamps.
    * `FAQs`: Question, Answer, Keywords, Category.
  * **1.2.2. API Endpoints (CRUD for Products & FAQs):**
    * Develop RESTful APIs to manage solar panel, inverter, and mounting hardware data.
    * Develop RESTful APIs to manage FAQ content.
  * **1.2.3. Core Calculation Engine:**
    * Implement `usable_roof_area_calculator` (based on dimensions & obstructions).
    * Implement `panel_layout_optimizer` (determines max panels for an area).
    * Implement `system_size_calculator`.
    * Implement `annual_generation_estimator` (integrating with PVGIS or similar data source).
    * Implement `cost_estimator` (pulling from product database).
    * Implement `savings_calculator` (factoring SEG and electricity price).
    * Implement `payback_period_calculator`.
* **1.3. Frontend (Basic UI & Data Fetching)**
  * **1.3.1. Initial UI Structure:** Set up basic React components for the main calculator page (input forms, result display areas).
  * **1.3.2. Product Selection:** Implement dropdowns/selectors for solar panel and inverter models, fetching data from backend APIs.
  * **1.3.3. Basic Input Forms:** Create controlled components for roof dimensions, customer info, etc.
* **1.4. API Integration (Initial)**
  * Connect frontend to backend to fetch product data.
  * Initial integration with PVGIS or similar solar irradiance data source (backend-to-external API).

### Test Phase 1: Unit & Integration Testing

**Goal:** Verify the accuracy and robustness of core calculations and API functionality.

* **Unit Tests:**
  * Write comprehensive unit tests for each calculation function (e.g., `test_panel_layout_optimizer_accuracy`, `test_payback_period_calculation`).
  * Test individual API endpoints for correct responses and error handling.
* **Integration Tests:**
  * Test the flow from frontend selection of a product to backend calculation.
  * Verify that data fetched from external APIs (PVGIS) is correctly processed.
* **Code Review:** Conduct internal peer code reviews for all completed tasks.

  * **2.1.1. Input Form Enhancements:**
    * Implement dynamic fields based on roof type selection.
    * Add input validation (e.g., numeric input, positive values).
    * Develop obstruction input method (simple list or coordinate entry for MVP).
  * **2.1.2. Results Display:**
    * Clearly display calculated **Number of Panels**, **Installation Time**, **Total Cost**, **Annual Savings**, and **Payback Period**.
    * Implement basic **visual representation of panel layout** (2D simplified diagram).
  * **2.1.3. Interactive Hints (`?`):**
    * Implement tooltip/popover components.
    * Populate tooltip content for key input fields and output metrics.
* **2.2. FAQ/Knowledge Base Integration**
  * **2.2.1. Backend API:** Implement API endpoint for searching and fetching FAQs.
  * **2.2.2. Frontend UI:**
    * Create the "FAQ" button/icon.
    * Design the FAQ modal/panel with a search bar and category filters.
    * Implement expandable list of questions and answers.
    * Populate the database with a **core set of initial FAQ content**.
* **2.3. Frontend-Backend Integration (Calculations)**
  * Connect input form data to backend calculation endpoints.
  * Display calculated results returned from the backend.

### Test Phase 2: Functional & User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Goal:** Ensure the GUI is functional, calculations are correctly displayed, and interactive elements work as expected.

* **Functional Testing:**
  * Test all input fields for proper behavior and validation.
  * Verify that all calculated results update correctly based on input changes.
  * Test the "Interactive Hints" (`?`) for correct content and display.
  * Verify the FAQ search, filtering, and expand/collapse functionality.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT - Internal Sales Team):**
  * Conduct internal UAT sessions with a small group of sales personnel.
  * Gather feedback on usability, clarity, and workflow.
  * Identify any missing information or confusing elements.
* **Performance Testing (Initial):** Basic checks to ensure the app doesn't lag significantly with common inputs.
